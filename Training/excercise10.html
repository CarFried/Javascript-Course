          1. Ask user for name
            Prompt -> first let
            Test
          2. print name backwards
            Ideas:
            Loop backwards i--
            Store name in Array and loop backwards
            make it to a function
            Questions:
              Loop through name with a loop (what do I see)?
              Loop through Array, what do I see?
                do I need to split the letters?
                How do I split?

              Do I need an array, why not?
              For what do I use an array and for what do I use an loop  -->
